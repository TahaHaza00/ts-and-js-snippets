# TypeScript And JavaScript Snippets
Typescript Snippets offers dead-simple snippets you can implement in your code to program faster. This was inspired by ES7/React Snippets. These snippets have a lot to offer and they are very useful if your looking to save time when you write code. Our snippets are open sourced so you can choose to commit and fix bugs if you 
want.

This is not a serious project it's more of a useful one (for the programmers in VSCODE)

# Contributing
To commit, please read our documentation or read our CONTRIBUTING.md
Or read this:
1. (If you don't know how to commit or create a pull request to a repository, please read these guides https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit)
When you commit to any repository to anyone or from you know that there is one main rule we all have in common. DON'T COMMIT STUPID THINGS. This is like the main rule where if you break this rule, your not allowed to commit again (if we don't forgive you, it depends). Wasting our time can be annoying sometimes and even frustrating, so that's why we suggest you read a commiting documentation like React's or Vue to understand how to commit to a repository.

2. When you commit, don't make it too long. When a user commits to our repository we of course have to read the code and understand it before we can push it into our codebase. And if the code is: not neat, ugly or too long, then don't commit it, it won't get pushed into the codebase and nothing gets changed. Most developers don't have much time to read code, (including myself) so wasting our time by sending such a long file won't help us go anywhere and you'll be blacklisted from commiting here again and possibly from other repo's (depending on what you do).

3. After you finished your commit, update the CHANGELOG.md file so we can show the people our newest and latest update. This way our extension is easier to understand and flip-through-back the times.

Once you finished reading these I suggest you reading another documentation like React's or Vue's (for contributing)
